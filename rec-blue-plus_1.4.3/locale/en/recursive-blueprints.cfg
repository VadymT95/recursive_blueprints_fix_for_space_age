[mod-setting-description]
recursive-blueprints-area=Position of the X and Y signals in the deconstruction or upgrade area.
recursive-blueprints-logging=Condition for displaying debug messages.
recursive-blueprints-deployer-deploy-signal=When "Both" is selected, the signal "0" is in priority.\nUse the signal "0" (zero) instead of the construction robot signal for consistency with nested navigation. And also to avoid the use of item-signals to control the deployer.
recursive-blueprints-old-scaner-default=New default settings set the scanner to be controlled only by external signals of the logical network. The output signals of the counters are set to virtual signals (characters). These settings are applied to newly built scanners or to scanners from blueprints if the settings have not been saved in the blueprints.
